Collection of my solutions to various problems from leetcode and elsewhere on the web. Occassionally some notes about the problem or background info.

I make no guarantees about quality of my work. It's mostly just a vaguely organized way for me to keep track what I've done.

**Update** this repo never really got off the ground because I focused on solving problems on sites with policies that discouraged sharing solutions publicly.
